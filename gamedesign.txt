What is the purpose of having lives?



	I find this question interesting because I am also curious if why does most of
the games have lives... This question is a must-ask question to different game developers
all around the globe to learn and discover the purpose about the importance of having lives
in a game. And I think this is a very important question because this reflects to the real
world in sense of lives. In game, if you don't take a good care of your life/lives, you
will lose the game quickly as careless as you are, like in real life, if you don't care
to your life that much, then you will be dead as unimaginable as you can think. But of course,
we are talking about the lives in the game, so I think it's good to be aware about things
such as lives when it comes to games or maybe even in other aspects of industry as well.

	I read some of the answers and I think those answers are reliable when searching
about the question's answer because the opinions/answers of other game developers are all
reasonable and they are not playing dumb about those questions, they take it seriously as
their passion. And not only the game developers, but also some players, they said that when
they play, they value their life as theirs, too, so that they can beat their enemy or at
least finish the game with their hardwork and awesomeness to the game...
