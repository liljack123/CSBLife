	How do I apply Wozniak's system for myself and for this course?

		Wozniak's system is for remembering things that have been learned. By remembering,
The way Wozniak remember them is when he is about to forget it. But of course, there's a day cap
of remembering things before forgetting them.

		I think I can apply this system for myself if there are some things that are very
important and must be remembered all the time. So I might apply this to myself when that time comes.

		I can apply this to my course, Game Design and Development when we are studying
about codes, because I think there are different codes that we have to study. And in order to remember
the codes very well, I might use Github as well, because I think it can be handy to our course.
