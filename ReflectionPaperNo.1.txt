My Reflection Paper on Star Recital program...



1. What Benildean core values have you learned for the STAR Recital 2011 performance?

= I think they are quite amazing and creative because what I've seen on them is just like a first time in
my life. And since that I came from a High School in our province, I am pretty much amuzed by their performance
because I'm like a kid that saw Jollibee mascot, and felt happy because of the event...

2. What scene/production did you like most?

= When the two kids speak in front of the audience. They speak straightly and I can say that they are kinda
gifted because of the talent that they have. They just speak clearly and that they speak like they are not
nervous at all... Really...

3. How does it affect you you as a Benildean-Lasallian?

= I think it might affect me a little because I'm still exploring the life of being a Benildean-Lasallian student...
But, I can say that it'll affect me a lot later on because it is like the play is a part of life being a
Benildean-Lasallian student... So I should make myself well organized and careful all the times.

4. Among the core values, what struck you the most based from the production you watched?

= I think the shadow play, because I am really amazed by what the've done! Just by the use of light, pieces of
paper and some cut-shaped pieces of paper, they've done a lot and that's really cool and artistic as well.

5. Give a short reflection from the production that you have seen.

= They done a great job. All the effects of the program is nearly perfect or shall I say perfect enough to
struck the audience by their talents. I know that I'm in a school where all students were like those guys that
performed in the play, so I will try to follow their steps in order to be recognized as well as I recognize them.
