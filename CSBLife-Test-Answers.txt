I. Have you ever failed an exam? What are the reasons for failing?

	Yes, because maybe I am lazy to study my lessons. I only study in the last minute before the examination. I am not that good in studying. And maybe because I'm not a perfect person to get high scores in exams.


II. For those who haven's failed an exam, what was your highest score in an exam? What do you think made you reach the top?

	I didn't answer this because I sometimes fail my exams. And my grades are always below or above average only.


III. How was your first experience of CSB Midterm Examinations? Knowing what you know now, what would have you done differently? What are you going to do again for the CSB Finals?

	My 1st experience of CSB examination is fine. Maybe because I studied this time unlike before when I was in high school, I will study harder this coming Final Examination in order to get high grades as well.
