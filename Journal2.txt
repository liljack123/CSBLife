Location: I am now at the Benilde's LRC, doing stuff like the Alice animation.



Hey Troy,

Good afternoon! How are you? If you're gonna ask me the same question, I just wanna say that I'm not good nor
better, 'coz I'm having a hard time for my project in CompFUN!!! Making an animation at Alice is so hard and
very confusing!!! I think I can't make a cutscene that is worth 1 minute that will impress our prof in the subject.
But I am willing to do my best and in fact, I'm going to finish my project tomorrow, for the whole day, just
to make sure that I'll submit the project on Monday... And today, our prof in Estheta just gave us our final
project!!! I think I'll be busy these coming days especially this week because of the tasks that needs to be done
PERFECTLY!!!

Hmmm...

Anyway, I would also like to share that I will have my Talumpati presentation in Filip11 on Tuesday... I guess
my time for the weekend will pass without playing because of the projects... But I will, I will try to play
once tomorrow and on Sunday even if I'm loaded with projects because my method for studying is "Play first, for
warming up and conditioning the brain, then study later, when contented on the results of the game. :)"...

And that's it! I think I shared enough... So, I am now leaving and gonna push this later when I got home...



Logging out... Jack (COOL!) hahaha XD

  = talk yah later.
