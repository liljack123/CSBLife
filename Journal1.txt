Journal Title: (Thinking...) I should call my journal "Troy" because I'm watching it right now. :D



Dear Troy,

I just wanna say that I am very problematic these days because of the projects, assignments and for the
incoming examination, and for the inrollment as well...

But not just in school, I also have these problems like lack of allowance, lack of sleep, lack of nutrition and
many more things that I lack... It's because that I play more than rest, I think...

Hmm... I think I have to make a 250 word journal so I should just talk continuously because I know that I still
don't reach the limits to have for the journal...

Ehhh... Anyway... I like playing Battle Realms(a yr 2000 RTS game) more often than TalonRO(Ragnarok Online, a
Private Server, that is...) because it's more addicting... And I admit that I like RTS games than RPG games...
And I am now practicing the "RUSH MOVES" in Battle Realms because I think it is some kind of wicked moves that
players should have in Battle Realms... And I would like to say that my favorite team is Serpent, many people
say that Serpent is the weakest, well, maybe it's the time to stop dreaming, because I am here! >:)
I can make the Serpent clan as strong as Lotus' or Dragon's or even Wolf's strength. Not just in strategy, but
in making soldiers as well... So That's it! And by the way, I am now practicing Wolf's clan in Rush Mode because
I think Wolf clan can also do what Serpent can even if Wolf clan train their soldiers slow...

Guess I reached the minimum limit of the journal, and I'll continue this tomorrow... I just wanna say good midnight
and "SLEEPING IS FOR NOOBS!" >:)



Logging out... Ysrael aka Jack
  
  = see yah tomorrow Troy!
