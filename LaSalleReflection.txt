<font color="silver"><font size="+3">The Quotation:</font><font color="olive green"><font size="+3">"Men of little faith"</font><br>
<font color="white"><font size="+2"><p>I think that Saint Jean Baptiste De La Salle wants the people to enlighten themselves that most of the people loses hope when difficulty comes. I think that he tells us that when we are experiencing hard times to anything, we give up and forgot the faith in our Lord, God. Saint Jean Baptiste De La Salle knows that all of the people that believes in God have faith in Him, but he noticed that they are forgetting their faith in God when the time that they are feeling down where the faith to God is much needed. And what we need is to believe and have faith in God everytime even if we are experiencing hard times or even if we are just relaxing in life. We must not forget that God have mercy and loves us all... That is the thing that I think De La Salle wants us to learn throughout the years.</font></p>
